# hello-world
Rahul, from the distant lands of Chennai, bids the world hello. 
Ere the suns sets on the west, this readme file will be complete.
Lord Tutorial bids me to tell about myself. And I shall honor his request. I reside in the magnificient city of Chennai, blessed with beautiful beaches and Tamil culture, among the plains of the province of Tamil Nadu, a southern state of India. Alas, this is all I can tell you for now, for the hours pile on and the sun sets among the distand hills of my land.
